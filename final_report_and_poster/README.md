The guideline of final report and poster can be found [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/project.html).<br/>
# Final Report
Your final write-up is required to be between **6 - 8** pages using the [provided template](http://www.pamitc.org/cvpr15/files/cvpr2015AuthorKit.zip), structured like a paper from a computer vision conference (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, etc.). Please use this template so we can fairly judge all student projects without worrying about altered font sizes, margins, etc. After the class, we will post all the final reports online so that you can read about each others' work. If you do not want your writeup to be posted online, then please let us know via the project registration form.

The following is a suggested structure for your report, as well as the rubric that we will follow when evaluating reports. You don't necessarily have to organize your report using these sections in this order, but that would likely be a good starting point for most projects.
Refer to [Gradescope] for more fine-grained details and explanations of each separate section.

- **Title, Author(s)**
- **Abstract**: Briefly describe your problem, approach, and key results. Should be no more than 300 words.
- **Introduction (10%)**: Describe the problem you are working on, why it's important, and an overview of your results
- **Related Work (10%)**: Discuss published work that relates to your project. How is your approach similar or different from others?
- **Data (10%)**: Describe the data you are working with for your project. What type of data is it? Where did it come from? How much data are you working with? Did you have to do any preprocessing, filtering, or other special treatment to use this data in your project?
- **Methods (30%)**: Discuss your approach for solving the problems that you set up in the introduction. Why is your approach the right thing to do? Did you consider alternative approaches? You should demonstrate that you have applied ideas and skills built up during the quarter to tackling your problem of choice. It may be helpful to include figures, diagrams, or tables to describe your method or compare it with other methods.
- **Experiments (30%)**: Discuss the experiments that you performed to demonstrate that your approach solves the problem. The exact experiments will vary depending on the project, but you might compare with previously published methods, perform an ablation study to determine the impact of various components of your system, experiment with different hyperparameters or architectural choices, use visualization techniques to gain insight into how your model works, discuss common failure modes of your model, etc. You should include graphs, tables, or other figures to illustrate your experimental results.
- **Conclusion (5%)** Summarize your key results - what have you learned? Suggest ideas for future extensions or new applications of your ideas.
- **Writing / Formatting (5%)** Is your paper clearly written and nicely formatted?
- **Supplementary Material**, not counted toward your 6-8 page limit and submitted as a separate file. Your supplementary material might include:
  - Source code (if your project proposed an algorithm, or code that is relevant and important for your project.).
  - Cool videos, interactive visualizations, demos, etc.<br/>
Examples of things to not put in your supplementary material:
  - The entire PyTorch/TensorFlow Github source code.
  - Any code that is larger than 10 MB.
  - Model checkpoints.
  - A computer virus.

**Submission**: You will submit your final report as a PDF and your supplementary material as a separate PDF or ZIP file. We will provide detailed submission instructions as the deadline nears.

**Additional Submission Requirements**: We will also ask you do do the following when you submit your project report:

- **Your report PDF should list all authors who have contributed to your work; enough to warrant a co-authorship position.** This includes people not enrolled in CS 231N such as faculty/advisors if they sponsored your work with funding or data, significant mentors (e.g., PhD students or postdocs who coded with you, collected data with you, or helped draft your model on a whiteboard). All authors should be listed directly underneath the title on your PDF. Include a footnote on the first page indicating which authors are not enrolled in CS 231N. All co-authors should have their institutional/organizational affiliation specified below the title.
  - If you have non-231N contributors, you will be asked to describe the following:
  - **Specify the involvement of non-CS 231N contributors** (discussion, writing code, writing paper, etc). For an example, please see the author contributions for [AlphaGo (Nature, 2016)](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html#author-information).
  - **Specify whether the project has been submitted to a peer-reviewed conference or journal.** Include the full name and acronym of the conference (if applicable). For example: Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS). This only applies if you have already submitted your paper/manuscript and it is under review as of the report deadline.
- **Any code that was used as a base for projects must be referenced and cited in the body of the paper.** This includes CS 231N assignment code, finetuning example code, open-source, or Github implementations. You can use a footnote or full reference/bibliography entry.
- **If you are using this project for multiple classes, submit the other class PDF as well.** Remember, it is an honor code violation to use the same final report PDF for multiple classes.

In summary, include all contributing authors in your PDF; include detailed non-231N co-author information; tell us if you submitted to a conference, cite any code you used, and submit your dual-project report (e.g., CS 230, CS 231A, CS 234).

# Poster Session
We will hold a poster session in which you will present the results of your projects is form of a poster.
- **Date:** Tuesday, June 11, 2018
- **Time:** 12:00 pm to 3:15 pm
- **Location:** Arrillaga Alumni Center
- **Who:** All on-campus students are required to attend. Local SCPD students are highly recommended to attend. Stanford students, faculty, and guests from industry are welcome!
- **Food:** Food and light refreshments will be provided.<br/>

Students: We will provide foam poster boards and easels. Please print your poster on a 20 inch by 30 inch poster in either landscape or portrait format. Posters larger than 24 inch by 36 inches may not fit on our poster boards. All students are required to submit a PDF of their poster before the event. See Piazza for details. Caution: Do not wait until the day before the event to print your poster. Many on-campus printers (e.g., EE, BioX) run out of paper or toner during the last week of classes. Many other courses also have poster presentations or academic conferences take place during this week and there is no guarantee they will be able to rush-print your order.

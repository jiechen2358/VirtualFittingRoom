# train_fashion.ipynb
It is a demo jupyter notebook that shows how to load, train and test the virtual fitting room program. \n
This notebook shows how to train Mask R-CNN on Modanet dataset. It is better to have a GPU, though, because the network backbone is a Resnet101, which would be too slow to train on a CPU. On a GPU, you can start to get okay-ish results in a few minutes, and good results in less than an hour.
